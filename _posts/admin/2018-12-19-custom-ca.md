There are a lot of places in Spinnaker which support the ability to configure custom Java trust/key stores for organizations who use internally signed certificates. In some cases, however, this isn't supported yet but you still need to talk to a service which serves one of these certificates. This post will show you how to import your certificate into a Java trust/key store and configure a Spinnaker service with it. 

_This document assumes that you have `kubectl` access to your Kubernetes cluster and are using the latest version of Halyard (either OSS or Armory's extension)._

1. Create a temporary copy of your system's Java trust/key store and import your internal certificate. If you're on a Mac, this will be located at `$(/usr/libexec/java_home/)/jre/lib/security/cacerts`. It will be different on Linux.

```
$ mkdir /tmp/custom-trust-store
$ cp {path-to-cacerts} /tmp/custom-trust-store
$ keytool import -alias custom-ca -keystore /tmp/custom-trust-store/cacerts -file {your-internal-certificate}
```

2. Use `kubectl` to create a Secret from your copy of `cacerts`.

```
$ kubectl create secret generic -n {your-spinnaker-namespace} internal-trust-store --from-file /tmp/custom-trust-store/cacerts
```

3. Configure a Spinnaker service with the new trust/key store using volume mount. In this example we'll be configuring Front50 with this new store.

```
# ~/.hal/default/service-settings/front50.yml
kubernetes:
  volumes:
  - id: internal-trust-store
    mountPath: /etc/ssl/certs/java
    type: secret
```

4. Redeploy Spinnaker using `hal deploy apply`.


The Spinnaker component for which you configured the volume mount should now be using the new trust/key store by default.
