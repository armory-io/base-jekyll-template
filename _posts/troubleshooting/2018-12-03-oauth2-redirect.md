If you've set up OAuth2.0 authentication for your Spinnaker cluster and are seeing redirects to the wrong page (for example, to `http` instead of `https`), try the following:

```bash
hal config security authn oauth2 edit --pre-established-redirect-uri https://my-real-gate-address.com:8084/login
```

This will modify your `.hal/config` with this field:
```yml
  security:
    authn:
      oauth2:
        client:
          preEstablishedRedirectUri: https://my-real-gate-address.com:8084/login
```

and add/create `.hal/<deployment-name>/profiles/gate-local.yml`:
```yml
server:
  tomcat:
    protocolHeader: X-Forwarded-Proto
    remoteIpHeader: X-Forwarded-For
    internalProxies: .*
    httpsServerPort: X-Forwarded-Port
```
