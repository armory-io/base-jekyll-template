## Problem

When Spinnaker attempts to connect to any client services behind a TLS endpoint, you receive the following error: 

`Reason: extension (5) should not be presented in certificate_request`

## Resolution 

It may be related to a Java and Go bug mentioned here: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/35722#issuecomment-557209799.

A potential workaround is to force Spinnaker to use TLS 1.2 by adding the following config: `-Djdk.tls.client.protocols=TLSv1.2`.

**Operator**

If you use the Operator to configure and manage Spinnaker, add the config to the service settings for the services that are making the call. The following example adds the config to Igor:

```
apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    service-settings:
      igor:
        env:
          JAVA_OPTS: -Djdk.tls.client.protocols=TLSv1.2
```

**Halyard**

If you use Halyard, add the config to the the `service-settings/<service>.yml` file for the service making the call:
```
env:
  JAVA_OPTS: -Djdk.tls.client.protocols=TLSv1.2
```
