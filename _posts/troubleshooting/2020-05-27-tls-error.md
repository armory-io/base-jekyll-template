If Spinnaker is attempting to connect to any client services with behind a TLS endpoint and you receive this error: 

`Reason: extension (5) should not be presented in certificate_request`

It may be related to a Java and Go bug mentioned here: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/35722#issuecomment-557209799.

The potential workaround is to force Spinnaker to use TLS 1.2 by adding the following `-Djdk.tls.client.protocols=TLSv1.2`

Using the operator it would be like this:

```
apiVersion: spinnaker.armory.io/v1alpha2
kind: SpinnakerService
metadata:
  name: spinnaker
spec:
  spinnakerConfig:
    service-settings:
      igor:
        env:
          JAVA_OPTS: -Djdk.tls.client.protocols=TLSv1.2
```

Using Halyard - update the service-settings/[service].yml
```
env:
  JAVA_OPTS: -Djdk.tls.client.protocols=TLSv1.2
```
