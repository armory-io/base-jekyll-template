A known issue when using Okta with Spinnaker results in the following 401 error when Spinnaker times out and the user attempts to login again:
```
{
  error: "Unauthorized",
  message: "Authentication Failed: Error validating SAML message",
  status: 401,
  timestamp: 1553109495710
}
``` 

<br><br>
Okta can be configured to timeout after a certain time, but by default, Spring doesn't accept SAML tokens signed by a user who authenticated more than 2 hours ago. We've added a configuration in Armory Spinnaker that enables you to set the SAML authentication age to match the age you specify in Okta.
<br><br>
Make sure you're running Armory Spinnaker version 2.3.0 or later and set this in your `profile/gate-local.yml` at the root level:

```yaml
saml:
  maxAuthenticationAge: <time in seconds for Okta timeout>
```
