### Question:

*This is a Q&A pulled from the Spinnaker Community Slack team, which [we encourage you to join here](http://join.spinnaker.io).*

Does anybody know if there are any plans to support Openshift? I doubt that Google would be taking this on, but curious whether any RedHat devs might be working on this?

### Answer:

 We have a few customers who use Spinnaker with openshift. You can use it by hooking it up to the kuberentes apis and treat it like kubernetes.
