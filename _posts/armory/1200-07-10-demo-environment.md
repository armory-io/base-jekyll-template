You’ll find everything you need to get a feel for how Spinnaker works and see various examples for real-world use cases. The video below will guide you through the demo environment, so you know everything to look for.

When you’re ready to install Armory Spinnaker in your own Kubernetes cluster, you can [do that right here](http://go.armory.io/install). Armory Spinnaker offers a free forever “Teams” plan for unlimited users.
